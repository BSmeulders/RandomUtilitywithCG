The included Matlab files run the algorithm described in "Nonparametric Analysis of Random Utility Models: Computational Tools for Statistical Testing". 
These modify, or replace functions found in the replication files of "Nonparametric Analysis of Random Utility Models" (Kitamura and Stoye, Econometrica, 2018)

Instructions.
- Make sure the CPLEX for Matlab toolbox is set up correctly. (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.8.0/ilog.odms.studio.help/pdf/gscplexmatlab.pdf0
- Copy the matlab files into the folder containing the matlab files of the Kitamura and Stoye replication package.
- Run RUMCG_00_Main to use the column generation algorithm for computing the test statistics and critical value.
